# Computational Thermodynamics

**By [Kyle Niemeyer](https://niemeyer-research-group.github.io)**

These notes contain material and example problems in thermodynamics, in the format of Jupyter notebooks, developed to supplement the course ME 540, Intermediate Thermodynamics, taught in the [School of Mechanical, Industrial, and Manufacturing Engineering](https://mime.oregonstate.edu) at [Oregon State University](https://oregonstate.edu).

These example problems are mostly adapted from those given in the (excellent) textbook *Thermodynamics* by Sanford Klein and Gregory Nellis {cite}`KleinNellis2017`. The original examples and problems in that book were solved using EES (Engineering Equation Solver), while all problems here use Python combined with [Cantera](https://cantera.org) {cite}`cantera`, [CoolProp](http://coolprop.org) {cite}`Bell2014`, and the [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) ecosystem of packages {cite}`2020SciPy-NMeth`, along with [Pint](https://pint.readthedocs.io) for converting units.
All artwork here is original.
